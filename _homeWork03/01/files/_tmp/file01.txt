A UTF-8 issue I've encountered is that of reading a URL with a non-UTF-8 encoding that is later displayed improperly since file_get_contents() related to it as UTF-8. 
This small function should show you how to address this issue: 

<?php 
function file_get_contents_utf8($fn) { 
     $content = file_get_contents($fn); 
      return mb_convert_encoding($content, 'UTF-8', 
          mb_detect_encoding($content, 'UTF-8, ISO-8859-1', true)); 
} 
?>
